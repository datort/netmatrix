# NetMatrix

NetMatrix is the software used in my little [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/aBDdeN8fB6Q).
In there I created a little Internet Bandwidth Monitor based on an ESP8266 board which gathers the required data from my router. You'll find all the details in that little video. Leave a like, if you like it. ;) 

This software is as is. It's written to my special requirements and may be an inspiration if you plan a similar project. Feel free to use and modify it on your behalf!
